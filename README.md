🎉 Welcome to ONU! Server Edition, a game designed for everyone in the **SI100B** course.

**The core logic of this game stems from your very own `ONU` class!** We've taken the initiative to adapt certain modules to ensure seamless gameplay on your web browser. We hope that as you dive into the intricacies of debugging, you can also experience a profound sense of accomplishment.

This game can be played by yourself or with robots (your own action method). Additionally, you have the option to invite your friends to join in the fun.

## Why You Might Enjoy It

Creating a class is undoubtedly a challenging and abstract process. Often, you find yourself immersed in code, tirelessly debugging without a tangible feel for how it operates or behaves.

To address this, we've transformed your class into a real, playable game—it's a game you can enjoy with friends at ShanghaiTech! As you reflect on the challenging days of debugging PA3, we believe you'll find a profound sense of achievement.

## How It Operates

The game's functionality is primarily derived from your `ONU` class. To get started, simply **import** your Python file, just as you would for "local tests". Adjust a few game settings, and it will work!

We've made modifications to the `action` method, allowing you and your friends to actively participate. Notably, the robots in the game employ **your own `action` method**.

And click "Source Code", then download and unzip it. 

## How to Play with Friends

Simply run the downloaded code. You'll get this in console:

```
Running on all addresses.
Use **your own web address** to access the application
```

Then have your friends connect to the same WiFi network, such as `ShanghaiTech`. Afterward, share the **web address** with them to embark on the gaming experience together.
